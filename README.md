# ✈️ Air Cargo Analysis Using SQL — Case Study Project

Welcome to this data analysis project focused on the **Air Cargo** industry, where SQL is used as the core tool to extract, manipulate, and present insights from aviation-related datasets. This repo contains a detailed PowerPoint presentation walking through 10 practical SQL problems relevant to air travel and cargo analytics.

## 🧩 Problem Scenario

**Air Cargo** is an aviation company that offers air transportation services for both **passengers and freight**, operating via partnerships with multiple airlines. The company seeks data-driven insights to:

- Identify **frequent customers** for loyalty programs
- Discover the **busiest travel routes**
- Analyze **ticket sales** and revenue trends
- Improve overall operational efficiency and customer experience

As a budding **Database Analyst**, you were tasked with running this analysis and delivering the insights in a clean presentation format.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The presentation solves practical business problems such as:

1. Designing an ER diagram for relational schema
2. Creating route detail tables with constraints
3. Filtering passenger data based on route ranges
4. Revenue and passenger analysis for business class
5. Combining names and filtering customers based on brand
6. Revenue threshold checks using conditional SQL
7. Managing user permissions at the database level

Each query solves a specific problem and includes expected outputs and real-world relevance.

## 📊 Datasets Involved

The following tables were used in the analysis:

- **customer** — Customer demographics and identity
- **passengers_on_flights** — Travel details per customer
- **ticket_details** — Ticket sales and pricing info
- **routes** — Flight origin, destination, and distance metadata

## 🧠 Key SQL Concepts Applied

- Table creation with constraints (`CHECK`, `UNIQUE`)
- Filtering with `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`
- Aggregation with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `SUM()`, `COUNT()`
- String manipulation (`CONCAT`)
- Subqueries and JOINs
- Conditional logic using `IF`
- User access control in SQL
